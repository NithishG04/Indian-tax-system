        <h2>Indirect Tax</h2>
        <p>Indirect taxes are taxes that are levied on goods and services, and are collected by an intermediary (such as a retailer or service provider) on behalf of the government. The end consumer ultimately bears the burden of these taxes. Unlike direct taxes, the taxpayer is not necessarily the one paying the tax to the government.</p>

        <h3>Types of Indirect Taxes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goods and Services Tax (GST)</strong>: A comprehensive tax levied on the manufacture, sale, and consumption of goods and services in India. It is designed to replace multiple indirect taxes such as VAT, service tax, and excise duty.</li>
            <li><strong>Value Added Tax (VAT)</strong>: A consumption tax levied at each stage of the production and distribution process. VAT was replaced by GST at the national level, but it continues to be used by states for certain goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Excise Duty</strong>: A tax levied on the production or manufacture of goods within India. Excise duty was replaced by GST for most products, but it is still applicable to certain products like alcohol and petroleum.</li>
            <li><strong>Customs Duty</strong>: A tax imposed on goods imported into or exported from India. It is aimed at regulating trade and protecting domestic industries.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Tax</strong>: Previously levied on certain services before being subsumed under GST. It applied to services provided by businesses, including telecommunications, transportation, and financial services.</li>
            <li><strong>Central Sales Tax (CST)</strong>: A tax on sales in inter-state trade and commerce, which was replaced by the GST.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Goods and Services Tax (GST)</h3>
        <p>GST is one of the most significant reforms in the Indian tax system. It is a single tax that replaced many of the previous indirect taxes (such as VAT, service tax, excise duty) and aims to simplify the tax structure.</p>

        <h4>Features of GST</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unified Tax System</strong>: GST integrates various taxes into a single system, making it simpler for businesses to comply.</li>
            <li><strong>Dual Tax Structure</strong>: GST follows a dual model in India, where both the Central and State Governments levy the tax. The tax is split into <strong>CGST</strong> (Central GST) and <strong>SGST</strong> (State GST) for intra-state transactions, and <strong>IGST</strong> (Integrated GST) for inter-state transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Input Tax Credit</strong>: Businesses can claim input tax credit for the tax paid on their purchases, which helps in reducing cascading taxes.</li>
            <li><strong>GST Rates</strong>: GST is levied at different rates for different goods and services, ranging from 0% to 28%. Essential goods such as food items and healthcare products are taxed at lower rates, while luxury goods have higher rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>GST Tax Slabs</h4>
        <p>The GST tax system in India has multiple tax slabs. Some common GST rates are as follows:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tax Rate</th>
                    <th>Goods/Services</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>0%</td>
                    <td>Basic food items, health and education services</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5%</td>
                    <td>Consumer goods, restaurant services</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>12%</td>
                    <td>Processed food, computers, and other technology products</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>18%</td>
                    <td>Business services, branded products</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>28%</td>
                    <td>Luxury goods, high-end vehicles</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Excise Duty</h3>
        <p>Excise duty is levied on the manufacture of goods within India. It was initially imposed on a wide range of products but has been largely replaced by GST. However, excise duty still applies to certain products like petroleum and alcohol for human consumption, which are excluded from GST.</p>

        <h3>Customs Duty</h3>
        <p>Customs duty is imposed on goods that are imported into India or exported out of India. It is designed to regulate foreign trade and protect domestic industries. The main types of customs duty are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Customs Duty</strong>: A fixed percentage of the value of the imported goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Customs Duty</strong>: Also known as countervailing duty (CVD), it is equivalent to the excise duty applicable to goods manufactured in India.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-dumping Duty</strong>: Imposed to prevent the sale of imported goods at prices lower than their market value in the home country.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Value Added Tax (VAT)</h3>
        <p>Before the introduction of GST, VAT was one of the main indirect taxes in India. VAT was levied on the sale of goods and was collected at each stage of production or distribution. Under GST, VAT is no longer applicable at the national level but continues to exist in some states for specific goods.</p>
